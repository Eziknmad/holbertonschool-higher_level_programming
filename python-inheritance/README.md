# Python - Inheritance

This project focuses on understanding and applying inheritance in Python.
It covers how classes relate to one another, how attributes and methods are
shared between classes, and how Python’s built-in tools help inspect objects.

- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit one class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What the default class every class inherits from
- How to override methods or attributes from a base class
- Which attributes and methods are inherited by subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance in object-oriented programming
