# Python ABC – Abstract Animal Class

## 📌 Description
This project introduces **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** in Python using the `abc` module. It demonstrates how abstract classes enforce method implementation in subclasses and prevent direct instantiation of incomplete base classes.

The project defines an abstract `Animal` class and two concrete subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, each implementing a required `sound()` method.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what **Abstract Base Classes** are and why they are used
- Use the `abc` module to create abstract classes
- Enforce method implementation using `@abstractmethod`
- Prevent instantiation of abstract classes
- Implement required methods in subclasses
- Write clean, PEP8-compliant Python code
